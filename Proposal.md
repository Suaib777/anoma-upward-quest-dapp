# Proposal: Anoma Upward Quest dApp v2

## Overview
The **Anoma Upward Quest dApp** is an intent-centric social quest platform that enables communities to participate in on-chain campaigns, collect XP, and earn rewards such as tokens or NFTs.  
By integrating **Anoma + Upward**, the platform ensures that quests are **decentralized, transparent, and verifiable**, while preserving user privacy.

## Motivation
Most Web3 social campaigns today are still centralized, hard to verify, and vulnerable to bot/sybil manipulation.  
By leveraging Anoma’s architecture, quests can:  

- Use **Service Commitment** → quest as a *service request* and participation as a *service offer*.  
- Build **TRUST-based reputation** to mitigate sybil attacks.  
- Apply **Hierarchy of Games** to differentiate fast vs. slow quests, making participation more structured.  
- Provide transparent and fair incentives for active contributors.

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js + Anoma Wallet integration.  
- **Intents / Smart Contracts**:  
  - Quest = *service request*.  
  - Completion = *service offer* + zk-proof.  
- **Anoma Upward Integration**:  
  - Validate quest activities (governance, transactions, social proof) via intents.  
  - Use **zk-proofs** to preserve privacy when submitting progress.  
  - TRUST score as a reputation system → basis for rewards and rankings.  
  - Quest classification via *Hierarchy of Games*:  
    - **Fast quests**: light actions (likes, small transactions, event join).  
    - **Slow quests**: heavier actions (governance votes, content creation, project contribution).  

---

## Development Timeline

- **Week 1–2**: Design quest flow using service request/offer + wallet integration.  
- **Week 3–4**: Integrate intent validation (zk-proof + TRUST score).  
- **Week 5**: Build user dashboard & reputation leaderboard.  
- **Week 6**: Deploy on testnet & run community testing.

## Future Plans

- **Quest Marketplace** → allow other projects to post campaigns directly.  
- **NFT Badges** → zk-proof based achievements, transferable across ecosystems.  
- **DAO Governance** → community-driven curation & quest approval.  
- **Cross-ecosystem Expansion** → leverage Anoma intents to connect quests across chains & communities.
